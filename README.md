# ✨ Setup (Laptop) ✨

Pragmatic setup for a daily-driver Ubuntu 24+ laptop — clean, fast, and calm.

---

## 🌟 One-command install (recommended)
```bash
make install
```
This runs bootstrap and launches the interactive setup. If `uv` was just installed, open a new shell and rerun `make install`.

## 🎛️ Common commands
- `make install`: one-command setup (bootstrap + interactive).
- `make setup`: run the interactive profile picker.
- `make dotfiles`: link dotfiles only.
